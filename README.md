# Quadratic Equations Solver

This repo provide functionality for solving quadratic equations.

# How to Use

You will need python 3.5. Use get_roots function from quadratic_equation.py. This function receives equation members as parameters and returns equation roots. 

## Examples

code

```
from quadratic_equation import get_roots

root1, root2 = get_roots(a, b, c)

```
terminal

```
python3
>>> from quadratic_equation import get_roots
>>> get_roots(1, 2, -3)
(-3.0, 1.0)
>>>

```

# How to Launch Tests

```
python tests.py

```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
